# Sort Visualizer
A sort visualizer made with C++ and SDL2.

This project started out as a way for me to learn SDL, and it originally could only visualize a bubble sort.  I've since added more sorts and it can display visualizations of bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, cocktail shaker sort, and radix sort.  Perhaps new sort visualizations will be added in the future.
